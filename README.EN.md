# AS05: Implementation of LLM-Based Conversational Assistant

Practical work on the subject Topics in Computer Science III of the Computer Science course at PUC Minas in which an LLM-Based Conversational Assistant should be developed that is capable of indexing vectors (text embeddings) from a collection of PDF documents to later answer questions asked through a conversational interface.

## How to run

To run this program, follow these steps:

### Use a virtual environment (optional and recommended)

#### Create the virtual environment
